    <h1>HR & Operations</h1>

    <p>
      I support people and delivery operations by improving processes, documentation, and internal coordination.
    </p>

    <h2>What I contribute</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Process improvement and documentation</li>
      <li>Team coordination and onboarding support</li>
      <li>Policy, compliance, and operational structure</li>
      <li>Change management and stakeholder communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <p>
      I keep operations practical and people-centred — structured enough to scale, but simple enough to use daily.
